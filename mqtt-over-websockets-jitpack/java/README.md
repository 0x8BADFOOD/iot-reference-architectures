MQTT over WebSockets in Java example with Jitpack dependency
------------------------------------------------------------

This example code shows how to use the Java library in the [MQTT over Websockets project](../../mqtt-over-websockets/java/README.md) with [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#aws-samples/iot-reference-architectures).

The benefit of using it as a library is that you don't need to include this code in each project.

To see how it is used look at the tests in the BasicMqttOverWebsocketsProviderTest class.

TODO
----

- Add tests for changing the default region

- Add tests for changing the endpoint address

- Add example of cross-account MQTT over WebSockets
