Results iterator example with Jitpack dependency
------------------------------------------------

This example code shows how to use the Java library in the [results iterator project](../../results-iterator/java/README.md) with [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#aws-samples/iot-reference-architectures).

The benefit of using it as a library is that you don't need to include this code in each project.

To see how it is used look at the tests in the BasicResultsIteratorTest class.
